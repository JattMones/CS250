# Lab07
This is the lab 7 submission for the EWG lab.

## Running The Program
To run the program, just compile the src folder and use the command

`java input`

This will bring the user to a command line interface where they can choose from
one of five options.
The user can interact with the menu however they please.

## Algorithms
The program utilizes the Prims algorithm discussed in class and is drawn from
our Princeton textbook. Using this algorithm, the program calculates an MST for
each EWG, price and distance

## Sources
This project largely draws from the Princeton textbook for implementation.

## Shortcomings
Our team would like to acknowledge that the program does not currently support
adding a route to the EWG currently. Although it does support adding
destinations. This is feature is not available in the command interface because
it does not explicitly satisfy the requirements for this lab.

## Part 2
1. If we suppose we use a stack instead of a queue, we would have to use a DFS 
method. Otherwise we could simulate a queue with two stacks to use BFS. 
2. There is only one mst possible, because it's a generic DAG.
