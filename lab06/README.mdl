# lab 06
This lab 06 submission is designed to support the
insertion, deletion, and visualization of the Red-Black
Tree.

## Running The Program
The program ustilizes JGraphT to display the Red Black Tree.
To compile you must run the commands given by Professor Mohan:


first,

`javac -d ../../../bin/ -cp .://home/j/jonesm2/cs250s2018/Labs/lab06/JGraphT/jar/* *.java`

then,

`java -cp .:/home/j/jonesm2/cs250s2018/Labs/lab06/JGraphT/jar/* com.web.RBTreeVisualizer`

To run the program, use  ` java Demo`  after compiling the files in the "Red Black Tree" folder.
Utilizing a command-line interface, the user will be asked to supply a root node.
Then, the program will continue to ask for additional nodes from the user. The insertions will continue
so long the user does type the `n` command. Once the user is finished inserting, the `n` command ends the
insertion process and creates a JFrame window that visualizes the final Red Black tree accounting,
for all of the user's insertions.
